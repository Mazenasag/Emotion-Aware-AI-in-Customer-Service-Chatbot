# 🤖 Emotion-Aware-AI-in-Customer-Service-Chatbot# 

## 📘 Overview

This project was developed as part of the MSc.TE program under modules ID 403/404 – _Requirement Identification and Establishment_. The goal is to design and prototype an **Emotion-Aware AI Chatbot for Customer Service** that not only answers user queries but also understands and responds to user emotions using advanced NLP and sentiment analysis techniques.

## ❗ Problem Statement

In traditional customer service systems, emotional context is often ignored. Users may express dissatisfaction, anger, or confusion, yet receive generic or tone-deaf responses. This project seeks to enhance user satisfaction and support effectiveness by integrating **emotion-aware capabilities** into a chatbot, allowing it to:

- 🎭 Recognize the emotional tone of customer input (e.g., frustration, satisfaction).
- 🧠 Adapt its responses accordingly.
- 📈 Escalate serious issues or negative emotions to a human representative if needed.

## 🎯 Objectives

- 🧑‍💼 Identify user and stakeholder requirements using HCI methods.
- 💬 Design a user-friendly, empathetic AI chatbot interface.
- 😃 Use sentiment analysis to detect and classify user emotions.
- 🔧 Develop a prototype using modern LLMs and UI tools.
- 🧪 Evaluate the design through user feedback and iteration.

## 🛠️ Methodology

### 1️⃣ Requirement Identification

We applied **User-Centered Design (UCD)** principles, involving:

- 👂 Interviews with customer service agents and users.
- 👁️ Observation of current chatbot limitations.
- 🧩 Use of affinity diagrams and personas to synthesize insights.

### ✅ Functional Requirements

- ✍️ Accept user input via text.
- 🧠 Detect and classify sentiment/emotion (positive, neutral, negative).
- 🤖 Generate appropriate responses using an LLM.
- 🚨 Escalate critical emotional inputs to human support.
- 🗃️ Maintain conversation history.

### ⚙️ Non-Functional Requirements

- ⚡ Fast response time (<1s).
- 🎯 High accuracy in emotion detection.
- 🔒 GDPR compliance (no storing sensitive data).
- 🖥️ Easy-to-use interface.

### 💻 Tools & Technologies

- **Frontend**: 🌐 Streamlit for a simple, interactive UI.
- **Backend**:
  - 🧠 **LLM Integration**: DeepSeek, Mistral, or Mixtral via LangChain and Ollama.
  - 💬 **Emotion Detection**: Hugging Face Transformers or custom-trained model.
  - 🔍 **Fuzzy Matching**: For intent classification.
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
- **Deployment**: Localhost or cloud (optional)

#📈 BLEU Score Comparison

This table compares BLEU scores for responses generated by **TinyLlama**, **DeepSeek**, and a set of **Static Responses** across 10 selected customer service questions.

> ⚠️ **Note**: The current BLEU scores are relatively low due to the **small test sample size (10 prompts only)**.  
> The primary objective was to **evaluate model behavior, coherence, and emotional alignment**.  
> A **larger-scale evaluation** with more diverse prompts is expected to improve BLEU accuracy and stability.

# How It Works

### 👤 User types a query into the chatbot.

1. 🧠 Message is passed through a sentiment analysis model.

2. 🎯 Based on emotion:

3. 😊 If neutral or positive → Generate response using LLM.

4. 😠 If negative → Response is adjusted with empathy, or escalated.

5. 📝 Chat is logged and can be analyzed for feedback.
